## title
Metropolis-Coupled MCMC analysis object
## description
The Mcmcmc analysis object keeps a model and the associated moves and monitors. The object is used to run Metropolis Couped Markov chain Monte Carlo (Mcmcmc) simulation on the model, using the provided moves, to obtain a sample of the posterior probability distribution. During the analysis, the monitors are responsible for sampling model parameters of interest.
## details
The Mcmcmc analysis object produced by a call to this function keeps copies of the model and the associated moves and monitors. The Mcmcmc analysis object is used to run Markov chain Monte Carlo (Mcmcmc) simulation on the model, using the provided moves, to obtain a sample of the posterior probability distribution. During the analysis, the monitors are responsible for sampling model parameters of interest.

## example
	# Create a simple model (unclamped)
	a ~ exponential(1)
	mymodel = model(a)
	
	# Create a move vector and a monitor vector
	moves[1] = mvScale(a, lambda=1.0, weight=1.0)
	monitors[1] = mnFile(a,"output/out.log")
	
	# Create an mcmcmc object
	myMcmcmcObject = mcmcmc( mymodel, monitors, moves, nchains=4, deltaHeat=5)
	
	# Run a short analysis
	myMcmcmcObject.burnin( generations = 400, tuningInterval = 100)
	myMcmcmcObject.run( generations = 400)
	
	# print the summary of the operators (now tuned)
	myMcmcmcObject.operatorSummary()
