(1) Download and install cygwin. Make sure that you include gcc!!!
(2) Add the path to cygwin64\bin to the 'path' variable. This needs to be before the other windows variables!!!
---(2) Download and install mingw/LLVM(clang).
((3) Download and install cmake.)
((4) Download and install git.)


II. Second, retrieve the RevBayes sources.
(1) Clone the git repository:
git clone https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes.git revbayes-master

III. Compile RevBayes.
(1) Open a terminal window and go to the RevBayes source directory if you haven't already done so, e.g., 
cd revbayes-master
(2) Next, go into the projects and then the cmake subdirectory: 
cd projects/cmake
