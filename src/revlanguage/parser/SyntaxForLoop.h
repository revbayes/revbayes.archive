     * @brief For loop syntax element
     *
     * This syntax element is used to hold for loops, more specifically
     * the definition of the loop, that is the part
     *
     *    for ( i in 1:10 )
     *
     * The entire loop construct is held by the statement syntax element.
     *
     * Here, we store the loop variable name and the in-expression. We also
     * help the statement syntax element execute the for loop by providing
     * functions that initialize the loop, finalize the loop, get the next
     * loop state, and test whether the loop has finished.
     *
     * When the loop is initialized, we put the loop variable in the
     * execution environment as a control variable, to make sure that it
     * is not included in DAGs if it appears in dynamic expressions. We
     * then assign values to it from the variable resulting from execution
     * of the in-expression. This variable needs to be a container with at
     * least one dimension (a vector), and we get consecutive slices out of
     * it from its first dimension. For a vector, this simply means that the
     * loop variable takes on each of the values of the vector in turn.
     *
     * Like in R, loops do not open up new local environment. All statements
     * in the for loop are executed in the outer environment, and the loop
     * variable remains there after the loop finishes, as in R.
