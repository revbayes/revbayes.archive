     * @brief Workspace variable assignment
     *
     * This syntax element class is used to hold workspace variable
     * assignment statements. The member variables are the lhs
     * (left-hand side) and rhs (righ-hand side) expressions.
     *
     * A workspace variable assignment is a statement like
     *
     *    i = 1
     *
     * using the equal assignment operator.
     *
     * A workspace variable assignment differs from a constant
     * assignment in two ways. First, workspace objects (moves, monitors, etc.)
     * can only be created using a workspace variable assignment. 
     * Second, model variables (integer, etc.) created using the workspace
     * variable assignment will not be included in any DAGs even if it occurs
     * in a dynamic (deterministic or stochastic) expression.
     *
     * The workspace variable behavior is typically used for loop
     * variables. The for loop variable is implicitly set to be
     * a workspace variable.
