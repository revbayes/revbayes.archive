     * @brief Singleton Parser class
     *
     * The parser relies on automatically generated code produced
     * by bison and flex, in the files grammar.tab.cpp, grammar.tab.h
     * and lex.yy.cpp.
     *
     * You use the parser by calling the processCommand function with
     * a string buffer containing one or more, possibly incomplete, Rev
     * lines. The function breaks the buffer into Rev lines using the
     * breakIntoLines help function. Then it cycles through the lines,
     * using the bison and flex code through the call to bison's yyparse
     * function. The call to yyparse generates one or more calls to flex's
     * yylex function, which in turn calls the global rrinput function,
     * defined in the Parser.cpp file. The rrinput function uses the parser's
     * getline function to get a single line of input from the global
     * stringstream rrcommand, which is loaded with one Rev line at a time by
     * the processCommand function before the call to yyparse.
     * 
     * The call to yyparse generates an error code if there is a syntax error
     * in the command buffer. The destructors in the bison-generated code should
     * deal with the deletion of the syntax element subtrees that have been created
     * up to the point when the error was encountered.
     * 
     * For each complete and syntactically correct statement found in the buffer, the
     * bison code generates a call to the execute or help functin of the parser once
     * the syntax element tree is complete. The execute function executes the syntax
     * tree corresponding to the statement, while the help function gets appropriate help
     * information if the tree corresponds to a single statement that is a help request.
     * This behavior is defined in the grammar.y file. Once the syntax tree has been
     * evaluated, it is deleted by the execute or the help function in the parser.
     *
     * Note that there can be nested calls to the parser, for instance
     * if the 'source' function starts parsing a file as part of the
     * execution of a statement resulting from the parsing of a
     * command buffer containing a 'source' call. Rather than using
     * multiple parsers to handle this, each with its own flex buffer, we
     * use a unique global parser. This works because we rely on the fact that
     * each call to processCommand generates its own command buffer with its
     * constituent Rev lines. By making sure we only call the bison and flex
     * code with one Rev line at a time, we avoid any issues with global state
     * flags or buffers that have to be maintained across calls to yyparse.
     * Nested calls to processCommand work because each call maintains its own set
     * of Rev lines. Once an inner call to processCommand has finished, the outer
     * call can continue processing its remaining lines, if any.
     *
     * If multiple Rev lines had been fed to a single flex buffer, then the remaining
     * lines of the outer call would have been discarded by the time the inner call had
     * finished. For instance, this problem would occur with a command string
     * such as 'source("somefile"); <this statement would be discarded>'.
     *
     * The parser class also supports processing of a partial command line, to find out
     * the parser state at the end of the command line. Local variables, such as
     * functionName, baseVariableExpression etc, as well as some of the public functions
     * support this use case.
