     * @brief Multiplication assignment operator ('a *= b')
     *
     * The multiplication assignment operator multiplies the value of the left-hand side
     * variable with the value of the right-hand side variable.
     *
     * Note that the left-hand side variable must be either a constant variable or a
     * control variable, and that the multiplication assignment is interpreted as a constant
     * assignment or a control variable assignment depending on the original type of the
     * left-hand side variable. Thus, if the left-hand side variable is a constant, the
     * multiplication assignment statement 'a *= b' is equivalent to the statement:
     *
     *    a <- a * b
     *
     * while if the left-hand side variable is a control variable, the multiplication assignment
     * is equivalent to
     *
     *    a <<- a * b
     *
     * Note that a multiplication assignment could not be a deterministic assignment, because
     * then it would be rejected as creating loops in the DAG, i.e., 'a' would be a parent
     * of itself.
