     * This is the interface for a class that reads in phylogenetic continuous character matrix data.
     * It uses the Nexus Class Library (NCL) to do the heavy lifting
     * for reading files in Fasta, Phylip, or Nexus formats. The function will take in a string (RbString)
     * as an argument that indicates the file location or directory location. If the path is to a file, then
     * that file is read (or an attempt to read it is made). If the path is to a directory, then the program
     * attempts to read _all_ of the files in that directory, and does so recursively, burrowing into other
     * directories in that path and reading the files there too. The function attempts to figure out the file
     * format type (Nexus, Fasta, or Phylip), whether the data is interleaved or not (if the file is in Phylip
     * format), and the data type (if the file is in Fasta or Phylip format). Currently, the program can read the
     * following:
     *
     *            A   B
     *    Nexus   Y   Y   
     *    Phylip  N   N   
     *    Fasta   N   N
     *
     *    A: Continuous data (not interleaved);
     *    B: Continuous data (interleaved);
     *
     * Note that some data formats do not support interleaving of data (such as Fasta) or reading of certain data types, so
     * the table is unlikely to complete with Yes's (Y) in all of the cells.
