     * @brief Generic container base class
     *
     * Container is the interface for all generic Rev containers, that is, Rev objects with a type of the
     * form element type followed by one or more pairs of square brackets marking the dimension of the
     * container. For instance, a generic Rev vector of Real elements will have type "Real[]", and a
     * vector of probabilities will have type "Probability[]". The actual generic vector types used
     * in Rev are classes deriving directly from either ModelVector (for ModelObject elements) or
     * from WorkspaceVector (for WorkspaceObject elements).
     *
     * More specialized containers derive from the generic container classes, and thus inherit all
     * of the container properties.
     *
     * Generic containers support assignment to individual elements by default, but derived classes
     * defining specialized classes typically override this behavior by appropriate modification of
     * the element access functions.
