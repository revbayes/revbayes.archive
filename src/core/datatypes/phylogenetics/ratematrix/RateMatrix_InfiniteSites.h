     * @brief Infinite Sites rate matrix class.
     *
     * This class implements the special infinite sites model rate matrix with the known analytical solution
     * for the transition probabilities. The infinite sites model assumes that there are no double hits at any site,
     * that is, there can be at most one substitution from an ancestral to a derived state. You can never go back again.
     *
     * Here we implement the extended version where it may be possible to have more than one derived state, but still
     * assume that there cannot be two or more substitutions at the same site and lineage.
     *
     * Thus, the infinite sites model has no parameter but can be applied to any number of states.
     * The resulting rate matrix is computed by:
     *
     *      |  -   1  |
     * Q =  |         |
     *      |  0   0  |
     *
