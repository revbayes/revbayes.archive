     * \brief The Model class holds an independent copy of the model graph (DAG nodes) contained in the model
     * and provides methods for convenient access.
     *
     * A Model object holds the model graph which is an independent copy
     * of the DAG nodes contained in the model. The model graph may or may not be connected.
     * The model graph is obtained by providing a set of DAG nodes to the model and the model
     * object extracts all DAG nodes that are connected to these provided nodes.
     * An independent copy of these nodes is then obtained. 
     * The model object simply provides access to these DAG nodes.
