{\`O}Inferences respecting populations, from which known samples have been drawn, cannot be expressed in terms of probability, except in the trivial case when the population is itself a sample of a super-population the speciÞcation of which is known with accuracy.{\'O} (Fisher, 1925, p.10).


Despite their growing appeal, however, there remains a troubling lack of clarity about what exactly Bayesian methods do and do not entail and about how they differ from their so-called classical counterparts. Bayesian methods are often portrayed as being based on a subjective rather than frequentist interpretation of probability, with inference being an updating of personal beliefs in light of evidence. In practice, however, most modern applications of Bayesian methods to real-world data analysis problems are characterized by pragmatism and expediency: Bayesian methods are adopted because they promise (and arguably often deliver) solutions to important or difÞcult problems. Increasingly, the subjective-Bayesian versus objective-frequentist account begins to seem like like historical baggage that has yet to be replaced by an account more in keeping with how Bayesian methods have evolved and are presently being used in psychology and other disciplines.}
