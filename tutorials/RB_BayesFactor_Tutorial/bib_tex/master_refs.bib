	Assessing Phylogenetic Confidence},
  journal = {Molecular Biology and Evolution},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {20},
  pages = {255-266},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling has become increasingly
	popular in phylogenetics as a method for both estimating the maximum
	likelihood topology and for assessing nodal confidence. Despite the
	growing use of posterior probabilities, the relationship between
	the Bayesian measure of confidence and the most commonly used confidence
	measure in phylogenetics, the nonparametric bootstrap proportion,
	is poorly understood. We used computer simulation to investigate
	the behavior of three phylogenetic confidence methods: Bayesian posterior
	probabilities calculated via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (BMCMC-PP),
	maximum likelihood bootstrap proportion (ML-BP), and maximum parsimony
	bootstrap proportion (MP-BP). We simulated the evolution of DNA sequence
	on 17-taxon topologies under 18 evolutionary scenarios and examined
	the performance of these methods in assigning confidence to correct
	monophyletic and incorrect monophyletic groups, and we examined the
	effects of increasing character number on support value. BMCMC-PP
	and ML-BP were often strongly correlated with one another but could
	provide substantially different estimates of support on short internodes.
	In contrast, BMCMC-PP correlated poorly with MP-BP across most of
	the simulation conditions that we examined. For a given threshold
	value, more correct monophyletic groups were supported by BMCMC-PP
	than by either ML-BP or MP-BP. When threshold values were chosen
	that fixed the rate of accepting incorrect monophyletic relationship
	as true at 5%, all three methods recovered most of the correct relationships
	on the simulated topologies, although BMCMC-PP and ML-BP performed
	better than MP-BP. BMCMC-PP was usually a less biased predictor of
	phylogenetic accuracy than either bootstrapping method. BMCMC-PP
	provided high support values for correct topological bipartitions
	with fewer characters than was needed for nonparametric bootstrap.},

	examples used in five unrepeated combinations from a total of 15
	published datasets. The procedure does not adjoin raw data sets,
	but instead combines the binary-coded factors of the trees, each
	tree from a different data set, together. This allows the combining
	of data that are only available as pair-wise distances with data
	obtained directly from characters of the organisms. It economizes
	the analysis of combined nucleotide sequence data which can be very
	large, and preserves information for each kind of data in the combination.
	The procedure allows for missing data as well, and can be regarded
	as a new consensus method -- mathematical properties have yet to
	be investigated. The desirability of combining gene trees, obtained
	from molecular data, to enable the inference of species trees is
	discussed in light of using this procedure.},

	of MCMC in Bayesian inference, review some recent computational progress
	in statistical physics, based on the introduction of auxiliary variables,
	and discuss its current and future relevance in Bayesian applications.
	We briefly describe a simple MCMC implementation for the Bayesian

  abstract = {A quantitative solution for Hennig's parasitological method is presented.
	Cladograms summarizing natural relationships among parasite taxa
	are converted into host-group characters by means of additive binary
	coding. Unrooted Wagner analysis followed by most parsimonious rooting
	produces a maximum information-content, representation of natural
	host-parasite relationships. Because host-parasite relationships
	result either from random colonization or from co-speciation, host
	relationships well corroborated by a multi-parasite analysis correspond
	to.host phylogeny. Poorly corroborated, host relationships indicate
	an ambiguous parasite message alerting a worker to possible host
	transfers. Thus, such analyses point out co-speciation and random
	colonization components of host-parasite systems. Single or multiple
	parasite taxa may be used. A host phylogeny based on non-parasite
	characters is neither necessary nor sufficient for studying phylogenetic
	aspects of coevolution, although such may be helpful in testing ambiguous
	aspects. Once a host-group cladogram based on .parasites has been
	established, phylogenetic interpretations for each observed host-parasite
	relationship may be made according to a listed set of necessary and
	sufficient criteria. Finally, evaluation of two models of coevolution,
	a "vicariance" model and the "resource-tracking" model, indicates
	that the latter cannot be extrapolated successfully to explain congruent
	phylogenetic differentiation of hosts and parasites and that the
	former model represents the general pattern of natural relationships
	among hosts and parasites.},

	course taken by evolution. The model used is that of a branching
	random walk, which is strictly valid only when the causes of divergence
	between populations are random genetic drift and variable selection.
	With suitable transformations of the data, evolution can then be
	considered as a branching Brownian-motion process. To keep the model
	as simple as possible it was supposed that no population becomes
	extinct and that each population splits, at a random time, into two
	daughter populations each identical to its parent. The problem was
	to estimate the form and dimensions of the most probable tree uniting
	the presently living populations. The ideal method of estimation,
	maximum likelihood, proved difficult and had to be replaced in part
	by alternative procedures. In addition to describing the available
	procedures in detail, a simple example is worked out fully, and the
	logical content and limitations of the methods are considered in
	depth.},

  abstract = {A critical issue for users of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
	in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling
	and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution
	of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence
	bounds holds promise for the future but to date has yielded relatively
	little of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC
	users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools
	to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a
	brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of 13
	convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical
	implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two
	simple models and conclude that all of the methods can fail to detect
	the sorts of convergence failure that they were designed to identify.
	We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating
	and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic
	procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations
	and cross-correlations, and modifying parametrizations or sampling
	algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible
	to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm
	is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.},

  abstract = {Assessment of the reliability of a given phylogenetic hypothesis is
	an important step in phylogenetic analysis. Historically, the nonparametric
	bootstrap procedure has been the most frequently used method for
	assessing the support for specific phylogenetic relationships. The
	recent employment of Bayesian methods for phylogenetic inference
	problems has resulted in clade support being expressed in terms of
	posterior probabilities. We used simulated data and the four-taxon
	case to explore the relationship between nonparametric bootstrap
	values (as inferred by maximum likelihood) and posterior probabilities
	(as inferred by Bayesian analysis). The results suggest a complex
	association between the two measures. Three general regions of tree
	space can be identified: (1) the neutral zone, where differences
	between mean bootstrap and mean posterior probability values are
	not significant, (2) near the two-branch corner, and (3) deep in
	the two-branch corner. In the last two regions, significant differences
	occur between mean bootstrap and mean posterior probability values.
	Whether bootstrap or posterior probability values are higher depends
	on the data in support of alternative topologies. Examination of
	star topologies revealed that both bootstrap and posterior probability
	values differ significantly from theoretical expectations; in particular,
	there are more posterior probability values in the range 0.851
	than expected by theory. Therefore, our results corroborate the findings
	of others that posterior probability values are excessively high.
	Our results also suggest that extrapolations from single topology
	branch-length studies are unlikely to provide any general conclusions
	regarding the relationship between bootstrap and posterior probability
	values.},

	of rapidly evolving pathogens and from ancient subfossil and fossil
	sources are increasingly available with modern sequencing technology.
	Here, we present a Bayesian statistical inference approach to the
	joint estimation of mutation rate and population size that incorporates
	the uncertainty in the genealogy of such temporally spaced sequences
	by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. The Kingman
	coalescent model is used to describe the time structure of the ancestral
	tree. We recover information about the unknown true ancestral coalescent
	tree, population size, and the overall mutation rate from temporally
	spaced data, that is, from nucleotide sequences gathered at different
	times, from different individuals, in an evolving haploid population.
	We briefly discuss the methodological implications and show what
	can be inferred, in various practically relevant states of prior
	knowledge. We develop extensions for exponentially growing population
	size and joint estimation of substitution model parameters. We illustrate
	some of the important features of this approach on a genealogy of
	HIV-1 envelope (env) partial sequences.},

	Criticisms which have been levelled by Farris (1981) against methods
	of inferring phylogenies from distances are dependent on one particular
	interpretation of the entity being inferred. If we take the branch
	lengths on the tree to be expected distances rather than path lengths,
	the major criticisms of these methods lose their force. Under the
	expected distance view, there is no reason to abandon distance measures
	solely because they fail to satisfy the triangle inequality. The
	expected distance interpretation fits naturally into a statistical
	inference framework for inferring phylogenies. This in turn provides
	justification for some of the most widely-used criteria of goodness
	of fit between a tree and the observed distances. However, the statistical
	framework does emphasize the weakness of distance methods if the
	assumptions of additivity of distances among the tree and of independence
	of the measurement errors of the distances are not met. The possible
	failure of additivity and of independence seem to be the most serious
	problems with using distance methods. These assumptions are dubious
	for many kinds of data often analyzed by distance methods. The assumption
	of a molecular clock affects the details of the computations, but
	can be fit into the statistical framework without difficulty. Given
	the validity of the additivity and independence assumptions, a statistical
	test of the clock could be performed.},

	recurrence relation for T(n,m), the number of trees with n labelled
	tips and m unlabelled interior nodes. A table of the total number
	of trees is presented up to n = 22. There are 282,137,824 different
	trees having 10 tip species, and over 8.87 x 10<sup>23</sup> different
	trees having 20 tip species. The method is extended to count trees
	some of whose interior nodes may be labelled. The principal uses
	of these numbers will be to double-check algorithms and notation
	systems, and to frighten taxonomists.},

  abstract = {The birth-death process is widely used in phylogenetics to model speciation
	and extinction. Recent studies have shown that the inferred rates
	are sensitive to assumptions about the sampling probability of lineages.
	Here, we examine the effect of the method used to sample lineages.
	Whereas previous studies have assumed random sampling, we consider
	two extreme cases of biased sampling: diversified sampling,
	where tips are selected to maximize diversity, and cluster sampling,
	where sample diversity is minimized. Diversified sampling appears
	to be standard practice, e.g., in analyses of higher taxa, while
	cluster sampling may occur under special circumstances, e.g., in
	studies of geographically defined floras or faunas. Using both simulations
	and analyses of empirical data, we show that inferred rates may be
	heavily biased if the sampling strategy is not modeled correctly.
	In particular, when a diversified sample is treated as if it were
	a random or complete sample, the extinction rate is severely underestimated,
	often close to 0. Such dramatic errors may lead to serious consequences,
	e.g. if estimated rates are used in assessing the vulnerability of
	threatened species to extinction. Using Bayesian model testing across
	18 empirical data sets, we show that diversified sampling is commonly
	a better fit to the data than complete, random or cluster sampling.
	Inappropriate modeling of the sampling method may at least partly
	explain anomalous results that have previously been attributed to
	variation over time in birth and death rates.},

  abstract = {Phylogenies that are reconstructed without fossil material often contain
	approximate dates for lineage splitting. For example, particular
	nodes on molecular phylogenies may be dated by known geographic events
	that caused lineages to split, thereby calibrating a molecular clock
	that is used to date other nodes. On the one hand, such phylogenies
	contain no information about lineages that have become extinct. On
	the other hand, they do provide a potentially useful testing ground
	for ideas about evolutionary processes. Here we first ask what such
	reconstructed phylogenies should be expected to look like under a
	birth-death process in which the birth and death parameters of lineages
	remain constant through time. We show that it is possible to estimate
	both the birth and death rates of lineages from the reconstructed
	phylogenies, even though they contain no explicit information about
	extinct lineages. We also show how such phylogenies can reveal mass
	extinctions and how their characteristic footprint can be distinguished
	from similar ones produced by density-dependent cladogenesis.},

  abstract = {Most methods for detecting Darwinian natural selection at the molecular
	level rely on estimating the rates or numbers of nonsynonymous and
	synonymous changes in an alignment of protein-coding DNA sequences.
	In some of these methods, the nonsynonymous rate of substitution
	is allowed to vary across the sequence, permitting the identification
	of single amino acid positions that are under positive natural selection.
	However, it is unclear which probability distribution should be used
	to describe how the nonsynonymous rate of substitution varies across
	the sequence. One widely used solution is to model variation in the
	nonsynonymous rate across the sequence as a mixture of several discrete
	or continuous probability distributions. Unfortunately, there is
	little population genetics theory to inform us of the appropriate
	probability distribution for among-site variation in the nonsynonymous
	rate of substitution. Here, we describe an approach to modeling variation
	in the nonsynonymous rate of substitution by using a Dirichlet process
	mixture model. The Dirichlet process allows there to be a countably
	infinite number of nonsynonymous rate classes and is very flexible
	in accommodating different potential distributions for the nonsynonymous
	rate of substitution. We implemented the model in a fully Bayesian
	approach, with all parameters of the model considered as random variables.},

  journal = {The Annals of Mathematical Statistics},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {The importance of stochastic processes in relation to problems of
	population growth was pointed out by W. Feller [1] in 1939. He considered
	among other examples the "birth-and-death" process in which the expected
	birth and death rates (per head of population per unit of time) were
	constants, bo and do, say. In this paper, I shall give the complete
	solution of the equations governing the generalised birth-and-death
	process in which the birth and death rates b(t) and d(t) may be any
	specified functions of the time. The mathematical method employed
	starts from M. S. Bartlett's idea of replacing the differential-difference
	equations for the distribution of the population size by a partial
	differential equation for its generating function. For an account
	of this technique,1 reference may be made to Bartlett's North Carolina
	lectures [2]. The formulae obtained lead to an expression for the
	probability of the ultimate extinction of the population, and to
	the necessary and sufficient condition for a birth-and-death process
	to be of "transient" type. For transient processes the distribution
	of the cumulative population is also considered, but here in general
	it is not found possible to do more than evaluate its mean and variance
	as functions of t, although a complete solution (including the determination
	of the asymptotic form of the distribution as t tends to infinity)
	is obtained for the simple process in which the birth and death rates
	are independent of the time. It is shown that a birth-and-death process
	can be constructed to give an expected population size $\bar n_t$
	which is any desired function of the time t, and among the many possible
	solutions the unique one is determined which makes the fluctuation,
	Var(nt), a minimum for all. The general theory is illustrated with
	reference of two examples. The first of these is the (b0, d1t) process
	introduced by N. Arley [3] in his study of the cascade showers associated
	with cosmic radiation; here the birth rate is constant and the death
	rate is a constant multiple of the "age, t, of the process. The $\bar
	n_t$ -curve is then Gaussian in form, and the process is always of
	transient type. The second example is provided by the family of "periodic"
	processes, in which the birth and death rates are periodic functions
	of the time t. These appear well adapted to describe the response
	of population growth (or epidemic spread) to the influence of the
	seasons.},

	Introduction into their Local and Global tree proposal operators.
	They use the canonical representation of the tree and change few

	This leads to topology changes which are reconstructed regarding the
	representation.
	
	
	In their experience one algorithm can not be sufficient for good mixing.
	
	
	They discuss the use of Bayesian MCMC and Maximum Likelihood and Bootstrapping

	study the phylogenetic relationship in a group of DNA sequences.
	Under simple models of mutational events, our method produces a Markov
	chain whose stationary distribution is the conditional distribution
	of the phylogeny given the observed sequences. Our algorithm strikes
	a reasonable balance between the desire to move globally through
	the space of phylogenies and the need to make computationally feasible
	moves in areas of high probability. Because phylogenetic information
	is described by a tree, we have created new diagnostics to handle
	this type of data structure. An important byproduct of the Markov
	chain Monte Carlo phylogeny building technique is that it provides
	estimates and corresponding measures of variability for any aspect
	of the phylogeny under study.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms play a critical role in
	the Bayesian approach to phylogenetic inference. We present a theoretical
	analysis of the rate of convergence of many of the widely used Markov
	chains. For N characters generated from a uniform mixture of two
	trees, we prove that the Markov chains take an exponentially long
	(in N) number of iterations to converge to the posterior distribution.
	Nevertheless, the likelihood plots for sample runs of the Markov
	chains deceivingly suggest that the chains converge rapidly to a
	unique tree. Our results rely on novel mathematical understanding
	of the log-likelihood function on the space of phylogenetic trees.
	The practical implications of our work are that Bayesian MCMC methods
	can be misleading when the data are generated from a mixture of trees.
	Thus, in cases of data containing potentially conflicting phylogenetic
	signals, phylogenetic reconstruction should be performed separately
	on each signal.},

	the simulation of a Markov chain with a specified {pi} as its stationary
	distribution. Hastings (1970) outlined a general procedure for constructing
	and simulating such a Markov chain. The matrix P of transition probabilities
	is constructed using a defined symmetric function sij and an arbitrary
	transition matrix Q. Here, for a given Q, the relative merits of
	the two simple choices for sij suggested by Hastings (1970) are discussed.
	The optimum choice for sij is shown to be one of these. For the other
	choice, those Q are given which are known to make the sampling method
	based on P asymptotically less precise than independent sampling.},

  abstract = {We extend our recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
	for Bayesian estimation of species divergence times to allow variable
	evolutionary rates among lineages. The method can use heterogeneous
	data from multiple gene loci and accommodate multiple fossil calibrations.
	Uncertainties in fossil calibrations are described using flexible
	statistical distributions. The prior for divergence times for nodes
	lacking fossil calibrations is specified by use of a birth-death
	process with species sampling. The prior for lineage-specific substitution
	rates is specified using either a model with autocorrelated rates
	among adjacent lineages (based on a geometric Brownian motion model
	of rate drift) or a model with independent rates among lineages specified
	by a log-normal probability distribution. We develop an infinite-sites
	theory, which predicts that when the amount of sequence data approaches
	infinity, the width of the posterior credibility interval and the
	posterior mean of divergence times form a perfect linear relationship,
	with the slope indicating uncertainties in time estimates that cannot
	be reduced by sequence data alone. Simulations are used to study
	the influence of among-lineage rate variation and the number of loci
	sampled on the uncertainty of divergence time estimates. The analysis
	suggests that posterior time estimates typically involve considerable
	uncertainties even with an infinite amount of sequence data, and
	that the reliability and precision of fossil calibrations are critically
	important to divergence time estimation. We apply our new algorithms
	to two empirical data sets and compare the results with those obtained
	in previous Bayesian and likelihood analyses. The results demonstrate
	the utility of our new algorithms.},

  abstract = {Summary: Estimating divergence times and rates of substitution from
	sequence data is plagued by the problem of rate variation between
	lineages. R8s version 1.5 is a program which uses parametric, nonparametric
	and semiparametric methods to relax the assumption of constant rates
	of evolution to obtain better estimates of rates and times. Unlike
	most programs for rate inference or phylogenetics, r8s permits users
	to convert results to absolute rates and ages by constraining one
	or more node times to be fixed, minimum or maximum ages (using fossil
	or other evidence). Version 1.5 uses truncated Newton nonlinear optimization
	code with bound constraints, offering superior performance over previous
	versions.Results: Availability: The linux executable, C source code,

  abstract = {Summary: Ever larger phylogenies are being constructed due to the
	explosion of genetic data and development of high-performance phylogenetic
	reconstruction algorithms. However, most methods for calculating
	divergence times are limited to datasets that are orders of magnitude
	smaller than recently published large phylogenies. Here, we present
	an algorithm and implementation of a divergence time method using
	penalized likelihood that can handle datasets of thousands of taxa.
	We implement a method that combines the standard derivative-based
	optimization with a stochastic simulated annealing approach to overcome
	optimization challenges. We compare this approach with existing software
	including r8s, PATHd8 and BEAST.Availability: Source code, example
	files, binaries and documentation for treePL are available at https://github.com/blackrim/treePL.Contact:

	Bayesian support values were, however, significant overestimates

	at the highest values (>99%). Although we found evidence for a branch-length
	bias contributing to conflict, there was little evidence for widespread,
	strongly supported among-gene conflict from bootstraps. The results

	when both viruses are present in the same host, genealogical evidence

	genomes will usually be more closely related to each other than to
	viral genomes present in other hosts and the impact of recombination
	on the genealogy of a sample of viruses from different hosts may
	be weak. We used this relationship to estimate the relative rate
	of intra-subtype HIV-1 superinfection in six urban populations. Comparisons
	of the population recombination rates estimated from the HIV-1 sequence
	data with population recombination rates estimated for sets of sequences
	simulated using a structured coalescent process suggest that intra-subtype
	superinfection rates in all but one of these populations may be as
	high as 15% of the corresponding infection rate. However, we caution
	that these estimates might be upwardly biased if variation in contact
	and mixing rates between infected hosts causes viral lineages to
	be concentrated in groups with higher than average superinfection
	rates.},

  abstract = {Ease and accuracy of typing, together with high levels of polymorphism
	and widespread distribution in the genome, make microsatellite (or
	short tandem repeat) loci an attractive potential source of information
	about both population histories and evolutionary processes. However,
	microsatellite data are difficult to interpret, in particular because
	of the frequency of back-mutations. Stochastic models for the underlying
	genetic processes can be specified, but in the past they have been
	too complicated for direct analysis. Recent developments in stochastic
	simulation methodology now allow direct inference about both historical
	events, such as genealogical coalescence times, and evolutionary
	parameters, such as mutation rates. A feature of the Markov chain
	Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that we propose here is that the likelihood
	computations are simplified by treating the (unknown) ancestral allelic
	states as auxiliary parameters. We illustrate the algorithm by analyzing
	microsatellite samples simulated under the model. Our results suggest
	that a single microsatellite usually does not provide enough information
	for useful inferences, but that several completely linked microsatellites
	can be informative about some aspects of genealogical history and
	evolutionary processes. We also reanalyze data from a previously
	published human Y chromosome microsatellite study, finding evidence
	for an effective population size for human Y chromosomes in the low
	thousands and a recent time since their most recent common ancestor:
	the 95% interval runs from ~15,000 to 130,000 years, with most likely
	values around 30,000 years.},

	analyses of DNA and protein sequences using maximum likelihood (ML).
	The programs may be used to compare and test phylogenetic trees,
	but their main strengths lie in the rich repertoire of evolutionary
	models implemented, which can be used to estimate parameters in models
	of sequence evolution and to test interesting biological hypotheses.
	Uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous
	rates (dN and dS) between two protein-coding DNA sequences, inference
	of positive Darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of
	protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins
	for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined
	analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and
	estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties
	in fossil calibrations. This note discusses some of the major applications
	of the package, which includes example data sets to demonstrate their
	use. The package is written in ANSI C, and runs under Windows, Mac
	OSX, and UNIX systems. It is available at http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html.},
