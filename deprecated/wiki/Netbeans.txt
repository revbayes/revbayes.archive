Conventions: File paths are relative to the repository root. 

## Preparations

Make sure you have Java (JRE) on your system: if the command 
```
$ which java
```
responds with a file path, like /usr/bin/java, then you're fine, otherwise browse to the [java download page](http://java.com/en/download/) and download the JRE. 

  
Now, browse to [netbeans download page](https://netbeans.org/downloads/) and download the C++ or "All" bundled Netbeans distribution. Navigate to the downloaded file in a terminal and run "chmod +x &lt;netbeans-script&gt;" then ./&lt;netbeans-script&gt; to install. Note, the "All" bundle will probably require JDK (Java Development Kit) to be installed on your computer, [download jdk](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). 

  
By default Netbeans has quite limited memory available and you probably want to increase it to make things run faster: 

  * Open the configuration file, &lt;your home folder&gt;/netbeans-&lt;version&gt;/etc/netbeans.conf in a text editor. On a MacIntosh, the path is likely to be /Applications/NetBeans/NetBeans\ &lt;version&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/NetBeans/etc/netbeans.conf. 
  * Prepend the settings to the default_options so that line will look like this: "netbeans_default_options="-J-Xmx2g -J-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC &lt;other settings&gt;". 

  


The Netbeans project described here will use the Makefile generated by the CMake script /projects/cmake/regenerate.sh. Before setting up our project it is conventient to have all the files needed in place so let's start with running these commands in a terminal: 

  * cd to /projects/cmake 
  * ./regenerate 
  * cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull 
  * make -j 4 (4 = the number of processors on your computer) 

## Netbeans setup

  * In Netbeans, Press CTRL+shift+n to start the new project wizard. Select category C++ and project C++ project with existing sources and move to next step. 

  


  * In this step, select the git root directory as source folder, and tick the "custom" mode.

  * Select the Makefile to use

  * Configure build settings. Alternatively you can set "build command" = "${MAKE} -j 4" and "build result" pointing to the "rb" executable.

  * Code assistance can be slow if choosing all files, so narrow it down by ticking "Custom" and append "/src" to the path suggested by Netbeans.

  * That's it, finish the wizard and compile your code by pressing the F11 key. 

  
Here are some handy keyboard shortcuts to start with: 

  * Ctrl+click, navigate to definition 
  * Alt+[left arrow], go back where you where before Ctrl+click 
  * Ctrl+r, refactor code 
  * Alt+shift+f, format code 
  * Ctrl+shift+c, comment/comment out code 

On [Netbeans wiki](http://wiki.netbeans.org/Keyboard_Shortcuts) you can download the full map for keyboard shortcuts. 

  * Happy coding!
